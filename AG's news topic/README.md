In this age of information overload, the ability to classify and organize text data is becoming very valuable. Natural language processing (NLP) stands at the forefront of this challenge, utilizing advanced computational techniques to interpret human language. This research focuses on the domain of document classification, an essential area of NLP that facilitates the sorting and categorization of textual content into predefined categories.
The AG's news topic classification dataset, a compilation of over 1 million news articles gathered from various sources, provides a rich testing ground for NLP methodologies. This dataset includes articles categorized into four major classes: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech.
The objective of this assignment is to explore and evaluate the efficacy of different neural network architectures in classifying text documents within the AG's news dataset. By comparing the performance of various models, including dense neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs), this study aims to identify the most effective configurations for handling the classification task.
Document classification models are pivotal in numerous applications. This report delves into the challenges of implementing such models, including issues related to model complexity, training data sufficiency, and the need for computational efficiency.
