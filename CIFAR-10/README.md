Computer vision is a rapidly advancing field within computer science, driven by innovations in neural networks and deep learning. In this report, I construct and evaluate deep neural network models for a vision task - facial recognition for mobile device authentication.
The traditional methods of mobile device authentication, such as usernames and passwords are not only cumbersome but also prone to security breaches. Facial recognition is a promising alternative. However, implementing facial recognition on mobile devices poses several challenges, including the need for efficient and accurate models.
This experimental research aims to tackle these challenges by exploring the development of a neural network model specifically tailored for facial recognition on mobile devices. Key questions arise before this endeavor: Would such a model require deep learning, involving more than one hidden layer of nodes? What advantages would employing convolutional layers bring to the model? Through empirical analysis and experimentation, I seek to provide actionable recommendations for the development and deployment of facial recognition models in mobile devices, paving the way for safer and more convenient authentication methods in mobile devices.
