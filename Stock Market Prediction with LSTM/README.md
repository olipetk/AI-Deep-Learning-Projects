The stock market is characterized by its inherent instability and unpredictability. For decades, researchers have sought to harness the potential of time-series data to forecast future values, with stock price prediction being one of the most challenging yet potentially lucrative applications.
Deep learning is capable of processing vast amounts of data in the financial market, improving the ability to handle and extract features from transaction signals, thereby facilitating effective stock return analysis (Qiao et al., 2022). Among the various machine learning models employed for time-series prediction, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks stand out for their effectiveness. LSTM, a sub form of RNN, is particularly good at handling data sequences by learning to retain only the most relevant information from a time window. This retained information is continuously updated based on the significance of new data samples, making LSTM a powerful tool for applications requiring sequential data processing. The unique architecture of LSTMs, with their ability to manage long-term dependencies through mechanisms like forget gates and memory, makes them especially suited for time-series forecasting.
Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in forecasting stock prices. These studies have explored various approaches, including the integration of economic indicators, market sentiment, and advanced neural network architectures, to enhance prediction accuracy. The success of these models underscores the potential of LSTM networks to improve stock price forecasting. This study aims to explore the application of LSTM networks in predicting the stock prices of Lyft Inc., leveraging historical stock price data.
